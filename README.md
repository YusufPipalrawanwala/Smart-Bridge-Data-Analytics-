**#📜 Exploring the World’s Heritage: UNESCO World Heritage Sites Data Analytics**
Welcome to the official repository for the "Exploring the World’s Heritage" project — an interactive Tableau-based data visualization initiative designed to uncover insights and patterns from the UNESCO World Heritage Sites dataset.

This project was developed as part of the Smart Bridge Data Analytics Program on Tableau, undertaken by Yusuf Pipalrawanwala from Avantika University.

🚀 Project Overview
This project leverages the cleaned and structured UNESCO World Heritage Sites dataset to create compelling, interactive dashboards and stories that help users explore cultural, natural, and mixed heritage sites across the globe.

Using Tableau, the project transforms raw data into visual narratives that answer questions on the geographical distribution, classification, and temporal trends of these world heritage treasures.

🔍 The interactive dashboards aim to answer:
Which countries have the highest number of UNESCO World Heritage Sites?

How are sites distributed across cultural, natural, and mixed categories?

What are the trends in heritage site additions over the decades?

Which regions dominate in specific heritage categories?

How can global heritage conservation efforts be better visualized for public awareness?

🎯 Project Objectives
✅ Provide an engaging visual exploration of the UNESCO Sites dataset
✅ Break down heritage sites by type, country, and region
✅ Show temporal patterns of heritage site listings
✅ Highlight top-ranking countries and regions in heritage site counts
✅ Deliver interactive and filter-enabled dashboards for deeper insights
